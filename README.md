# Floating-Values-In-Java
It is the General thing beginners are need to know.

Generally, JAVA considered all floating-point numbers doubles.
1. Initialize the double-type variable
   We can see how to assign floating numbers to double-type variable.
   See the output without any problem. But declaring the floating-type variable can't be done using this normal way in JAVA.
2. Initialize the float-type variable.
   Try the above type to assign values to a float-type variable.
   Initialize the float variable using the above method, and we can see the error. The JAVA compiler says we provided double-type values. not float. This is the reason we cannot assign floating numbers directly to float variables. We can initialize the float variable in a specific way.
   Correct method for initializing the floating variable in Java. In the initialization, we should add "F" or "f" to the end of the floating number before a semicolon. This is the way to initialize the float variable in JAVA.
